### How You'll Learn



###### Hands-on coding environments

You don’t get better at swimming by watching others. Coding is no different. Practice as you learn with live code environments inside your browser.



###### Faster than videos

Videos are holding you back. The average video tutorial is spoken at 150 words per minute, while you can read at 250. That‘s why our courses are text-based.



###### No set-up required

Start learning immediately instead of fiddling with SDKs and IDEs. It‘s all on the cloud.



###### Progress you can show

Built in assessments let you test your skills. Completion certificates let you show them off.
